<h4>Computer Science Lab Assistance</h4>
<p>Assisted students on labs in the Computer Science courses. Helped with projects in Data Structures, Algorithms, and web design. Some of my responsibilities required debugging exisiting code, and also helping students get started on labs. I was like another professor for these students teaching them what they needed to know to be successful in the class and the tech field.</p>

<h4>Amazon Web Services Solutions Architect Intern</h4>
<p>In the summer of 2020, I worked remotely for Amazon Web Services as a Solutions Architect Intern. My role included a variety of responsibilities to learn about the role. I shadowed customer calls every week to observe how to communicate with customers. I was given a project to architect and implement the back end of a flash card learning app hosted on AWS. In this project, I built an API, coded the learning algorithm, as well as the managment of the database. I also entered and won an Alexa hackation where my team built an Alexa skill to help onboard interns. Finally, I recieved my AWS Cloud Practioner certification.</p>

<h4>Cloud Computing Pathfinder Intern at NASA</h4>
<p>I worked at NASA Goddard Campus in the Cloud Computing IT Soltuions Team during the summer of 2019. I was provided the architecture of an application to be build on Amazon Web Services and spent the summer implementing it. I automated a connection to an API in order to download thousands of data files and store it in a S3 bucket. I used those files to train a model to read and tag scientific articles with relevant terms in order to search these articles more accurately. I learned and used concepts from Natural Language Processing. I also competed in an AWS DeepRacer event where I trained a self-driving car through Reinforcement learning.</p>

<h4>Music Database Application for Database Managment</h4>
<p>This was my final project for my Database Managment class. We learned how to design, build, and manage a relational database. We applied what we learned in this final project.</i>
<i>Our final database stores user music data. Our application was built in the Python coding language. The functionality allows the creation of concerts, viewing songs and albums, searching for a playlist, deleting data, modifying data, and viewing members of a band.</i>
<i>I had the role of Project Manager and I also built the framework of the application. I completed the functionality for creation, viewing, updating, and deleting concerts in the database.</p>
